# Lemonade Tapper's

This is a Java game developed as a Team for a Computer Science course. It is based on the popular game Beer Tapper's. To make the game more appropriate for minors, we decided to remove the Beer component and replaced it with Lemonade instead. The game follows Java's Object-Oriented Progrmaming (OOP) Principles and was created using Java's Swing GUI widget toolkit, which resulted in a smooth graphical interface.
