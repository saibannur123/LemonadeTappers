# Lemonade Tapper's

This is a Java game developed as a Team for a Computer Science course. It is based on the popular game Beer Tapper's. To make the game more appropriate for minors, we decided to remove the Beer component and replaced it with Lemonade instead. The game follows Java's Object-Oriented Progrmaming (OOP) Principles and was created using Java's Swing GUI widget toolkit, which resulted in a smooth graphical interface. 

## Instructions

In tapper's, the player is a bartender serving lemonade to thirsty customers. When a drink comes into contact with a customer, it pushes them back. However, there is a chance they return an empty mug. There are three ways to lose: A customer reaches the end of the table, you allow an empty mug to fall on the floor, or you send a mug down a table with no customers, where it falls off the table. There are three levels in this game, each level will involve serving a specific amount of lemonade (found top right corner). Serving the required amount will allow you you to move on to the next level. Failing to do so will bring you back to the beginning.
